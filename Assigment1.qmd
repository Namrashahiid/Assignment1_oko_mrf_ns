## Introduction:

In this assignment we are going to Calculate GDP per capita for 8 subset of countries sub-regional (NUTS3).
We are group two and will therefore examine these countries:

-   Ireland (IE)

-   Poland (PL)

-   Spain (ES)

-   Slovania (SI)

-   Netherlands (NL)

-   Greece (EL)

-   Norway (NO)

-   Albania (AL

## Data:

The main purpose to study this dataset from Eurostat is to analyse regional inequality.
To do so we have to use GDP (Gross Domestic Product), at the market and population data by NUTS 3 regions.

Like mentioned in this assignment we will use GDP per capita and which is based on population by NUTS.

One important thing to come up here with is that, we calculate GDP per capita by using this formula:

## Sub-national GDP

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(vtable)
library(dineq)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
gdpfile <- read.csv('nama_10r_3gdp.csv')
populationfile <- read_csv("demo_r_pjanaggr3.csv")

gdpdata <- gdpfile %>%
  rename(Year = TIME_PERIOD, GDP = OBS_VALUE, Region = geo)

populationdata <- populationfile %>% 
  rename(Year = TIME_PERIOD, Population = OBS_VALUE, Region = geo)
```

### GDP per capita calculation:

We are here calcualting GDP per capita:

Statistically explained:

**y*i*= GDP*i*/ population*i***

```{r}
# Calculate GDP per capita
tmp <- gdpdata %>%
  #combine gdpr data with population data with 
  # the same year and country
  left_join(populationdata, by = c("Region", "Year")) %>% 
  select(Region, Year, GDP, Population) %>% 
  mutate(
    GDP_capita = (GDP * 1000000)/Population
  )
```

```{r}
na.omit(tmp)
```

### Describe the data (GDP per capita) using the meta data description from Eurostat:

What we can describe out from our data (GDP per capita) using meta data description is that the GDP measures the value of total final output.
Now the question is how does GDP per capita calculated?
To answer this, we can look at the formula over.

Metadata can be defined as information that is needed to be able to use and intercepted statistics.
Main function of metadata is to explain data by giving definition of for example according to our data, region, year, GDP, population, GDP capita.

When we talk about the table, what we can find is

### 

Report the essential descriptive statistic

```{r}
# Report the essential descriptive statistics 
# for you data set (Mean, Min, Max,..:)
tmp %>% 
  select(GDP, Population) %>% 
  # . to stop RStudio complaining about no data
  vtable::st(.)
```

## Regional inequity

The first files only contains data on NUTS3 level.
In this part of the assignment we need data on NUTS2 level, therefore we need a new file.
For the next submission, we can download a new data file with all data available, if needed.

```{r}
#NUTS2 files
library(readr)
gdpfile2 <- read.csv('nama_10r_3gdp_nuts2.csv')
populationfile2 <- read_csv("demo_r_pjanaggr3_nuts2.csv")

gdpdata2 <- gdpfile2 %>%
  rename(Year = TIME_PERIOD, GDP = OBS_VALUE, Region = geo)

populationdata2 <- populationfile2 %>% 
  rename(Year = TIME_PERIOD, Population = OBS_VALUE, Region = geo)
```

```{r}
# Calculate GDP per capita for NUTS2
tmp_ginie <- gdpdata2 %>%
  #combine gdpr data with population data with 
  # the same year and country
  left_join(populationdata2, by = c("Region", "Year")) %>% 
  select(Region, Year, GDP, Population) %>% 
  mutate(
    GDP_capita2 = (GDP * 1000000)/Population
  )
```

### Essential descriptive statistics for NUTS2

```{r}
# Report the essential descriptive statistics 
# for you data set (Mean, Min, Max,..:)
tmp_ginie %>% 
  select(GDP, Population) %>% 
  # . to stop RStudio complaining about no data
  vtable::st(.)
```

```{r}
kable(summary(tmp_ginie[,3:5]))
```

```{r}
tmp_ginie$GDP_capita <- as.numeric(tmp_ginie$GDP_capita)
tmp_ginie$Population <- as.numeric(tmp_ginie$Population)
```

```{r}
gini.wtd(tmp_ginie$GDP_capita, weights = tmp_ginie$Population)
```

```{r}
tmp_ginie <- tmp_ginie %>%
  mutate(NUTS2 = substr(tmp_ginie$Region,1,4))

tmp_ginie <- tmp_ginie %>%
  mutate(NUTS = substr(tmp_ginie$Region,1,2))

na.omit(tmp_ginie)

tmp_ginie %>% 
  group_by(NUTS2) %>%
  na.exclude(tmp_ginie) %>%
  mutate(GINI_NUTS2 = gini.wtd(GDP_capita, weigths = Population)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
kable(summary(tmp_ginie[8]))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = tmp_ginie) + geom_density(aes(x = GINI_NUTS2), 
fill = "maroon", col = "maroon", alpha = 0,2) + theme_bw()
```

## Discuss briefly if there are noteworthy outliers:

An important thing to come up here is that an outlier is a value or an observation that is distant from another observations, that is to say, a data point that differs significantly from other observations.

An observation must always be compared to other observations made on the same phenomenon.
In this assignment the focus is gdp per capita and gdp.

```{r}
#data %>% filer(id_nuts0=="FR") %>% 
  #distinct(id_nuts, year,.keep_all=TRUE) %>% 
  #ggplot(aes(x = year, y=gini_n2, fill=id_nuts2, coloR=id_nuts2)) + 
  #geom_point(lwd = .8) + 
  #labs(x = "Year", y = "Gini")
```

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(id_nuts0=="DE" , year==2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, gdp_pc_n3) %>%
  slice_min(gdp_pc_n3, n=3)
```
