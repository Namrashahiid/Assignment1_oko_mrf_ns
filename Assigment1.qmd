## Introduction:

In this assignment we are going to Calculate GDP per capita for 8 subset of countries sub-regional (NUTS3).
We are group two and will therefore examine these countries:

-   Ireland (IE)

-   Poland (PL)

-   Spain (ES)

-   Slovania (SI)

-   Netherlands (NL)

-   Greece (EL)

-   Norway (NO)

-   Albania (AL

## Data:

The main purpose to study this dataset from Eurostat is to analyse regional inequality.
To do so we have to use GDP (Gross Domestic Product), at the market and population data by NUTS 3 regions.

## Sub-national GDP

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(vtable)
library(dineq)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(readr)
library(rio)
```

Files "Nama_10r_3gdp.csv" and "demo_r\_pjanaggr3.csv" are different dataset.
We will work with these two dataset throghout this assignment.

When it comes to what these dataset contains, it is data for GDP on nuts 3 level for different countries.
We find different data in the columns of the dataset of "Nama_10r_3gdp.csv".
This dataset contains data on Nuts 3 level.

We are also using dataset: "Demo_r\_pjanaggr3.csv".
This dataset contains data for population data on Nuts 3 level.

```{r}
#Import data from Eurostat
gdpfile <- import("nama_10r_3gdp.csv")
popfile <- import("demo_r_pjanaggr3.csv")

#Clean data 
gdpfile %<>% select(unit, geo, TIME_PERIOD, OBS_VALUE)
popfile %<>% select(unit, geo, TIME_PERIOD, OBS_VALUE)

# Filter for the countries we are going to study and change variablenames
gdpdata <- filter(gdpfile,unit == "MIO_EUR" & (grepl('IE...', geo) | grepl('PL...', geo) | grepl('ES...', geo) | grepl('SI...', geo) | grepl('NL...', geo) | grepl('ES...', geo) | grepl('NO...', geo) | grepl('AL...', geo))) %>%
  mutate(gdp_n3 = OBS_VALUE, year = TIME_PERIOD, id_nuts3 = geo) %>%
  select(gdp_n3, year, id_nuts3)

# Filter for gdp per capita
popdata <- filter(popfile,unit == "NR") %>% 
  mutate(pop = OBS_VALUE, year = TIME_PERIOD, id_nuts3 = geo) %>%
  select(pop, year, id_nuts3)

#Generate main data frame
tmp <- merge(popdata, gdpdata, by = c("year", "id_nuts3"))

#Gen Nuts 2 id
tmp %<>%
  mutate(id_nuts2 = substr(id_nuts3,1,4))

#Gen Nuts 1 id
tmp %<>%
  mutate(id_nuts0 = substr(id_nuts3,1,2))
```

### GDP per capita calculation:

Like mentioned in this assignment we will use GDP per capita and which is based on population by NUTS.

One important thing to come up here with is that, we calculate GDP per capita by using this formula:

![](images/paste-1EADC664.png){width="253"}

We are here calcualting GDP per capita:

Statistically explained:

**y*i* = GDP*i*/ population*i***

```{r}
# Calculate GDP per capita
tmp %<>%
  mutate(GDP_capita = (gdp_n3 * 1000000)/pop)
```

```{r}
tmp_gdpcapita <- tmp %>%
  select(year, id_nuts3, pop, GDP_capita)
#na.omit(tmp_gdpcapita)
```

### Describe the data (GDP per capita) using the meta data description from Eurostat:

What we can describe out from our data (GDP per capita) using meta data description is that the GDP measures the value of total final output.
Now the question is how does GDP per capita calculated?
To answer this, we can look at the formula over.

Metadata can be defined as information that is needed to be able to use and intercepted statistics.
Main function of metadata is to explain data by giving definition of for example according to our data, region, year, GDP, population, GDP capita.

We have now information of GDP per capita of different regions.

```{r}
# Report the essential descriptive statistics 
# for you data set (Mean, Min, Max,..:)
tmp %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, pop, GDP_capita) %>% 
  # . to stop RStudio complaining about no data
  st()
```

When we look at this table we can see is: deceptive statistics of data, we see data of different regions.

When we see the Summay statistics, we can see different type of data, which is first of all: Variables such as: year, pop, GDP_capita.
After that we find N Mean.
When we look at the difference between the statistics such as Max and Min, and if we compare both variables, there is no such major difference between the numbers.
This is quite sensible.

```{r}
tmp %>%  distinct(id_nuts0, year,.keep_all=TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = GDP_capita, fill = id_nuts0, color = id_nuts0)) +
  geom_line(lwd = .8) +
   labs(x = "Year", y = "GDP per capita")
```

***Graph: 1***

When we look at graph 1, we can see that Norway´s GDP are on the top (the blue line on top).
Norway have the highest GDP per capita.
Albania on the other side have the lowest GDP per capita.
Orange line is refering Albania´s GDP per capita.
If we compare Norway´s GDP with Albania´s.
There is huge difference there, because Norway is on the top and Albania on the other side at it´s lowest.

If we specify the GDP per capita for Norway line (blue line), we can see that it started pretty nice in around 2006, but then suddenly we can see it kind of like had decline in GDP per capita.
The reason behind this most probably because of the financial crisis, which affected the society in years 2008-2009.
Suddenly if we see GDP per capita started raising from 2009 again, and had its small fall downs in around 2015, and it raised again.

In the middle the lined are showing the other countries.

```{r}
tmp_1 <- tmp %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>%  select(GDP_capita, id_nuts3) %>% 
  slice_min(GDP_capita, n = 10) %>%  select(id_nuts3)

tmp %>%   
  filter(id_nuts3 %in% tmp_1 $ id_nuts3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = GDP_capita, fill = id_nuts3, color = id_nuts3)) +
  geom_line(lwd = .8) +
   labs(x = "Year", y = "GDP per capita")
```

***Graph 2:***

Here we can see the GDP per capita for polish regions.
If we look at the orange line, which refers to PL214, we see that it had its down period to start with.
Not only (PL214) the orange line, but also all the other regions, does not start good.
PL214 (the orange line) had it´s real rise after 2010.
PL214 had its down time between years 2008-2009, most probably because of the financial crisis, which caused chaos in the whole world.

```{r}
tmp_1 <- tmp %>% 
  filter(year==2010) %>%  
  select(GDP_capita, id_nuts3)  %>% 
  slice_max(GDP_capita, n = 10) %>%  
  select(id_nuts3)

tmp %>%   
  filter(id_nuts3 %in% tmp_1$id_nuts3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = GDP_capita, fill = id_nuts3, color = id_nuts3)) +
  geom_line(lwd = .8) +
   labs(x = "Year", y = "GDP per capita")
```

## Individual country cases

With this GDP per capita for specific countries we can filter our information/data easily afterwards in this assignment.
This can for example be done by finding the wealthiest and not wealthiest regions.

### GDP per capita for Norway:

```{r}
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "NO" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(gdp_n3, pop, GDP_capita) %>%
  st()
```

When we look at the GDP per capita for Norway, we can see that there is no such big difference between the values under summary statistics.
Such as Min and Max values for GDP per Capita for Norway is exactly the same.

### GDP per capita for Spain:

```{r}
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "ES" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, GDP_capita) %>%
  slice_max(GDP_capita, n = 3)
```

***Table 1:***

When we look at this GDP per capita formula up, we find 3 least wealthiest regions in Spain.
When we find GDP per capita for regions, we specify and go more in the depth of the GDP per capita research.
What we see in table 1 is that the GDP per capita for ES211 (the first region) and ES300 (the second region and ES212 (the third region).
There is no such big difference in them.
We can say that there is no outliers in the dataset of the regions in Spain, because the observation between these regions are somehow consistent.

### 

```{r}
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "ES" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, GDP_capita) %>%
  slice_min(GDP_capita, n = 3)
```

When we see the GDP_capita here, the conclusion here for this is the same for this country with no such big difference between the regions.

### GDP per capita for another country: 

..............
hva skulle komme her?

## Regional inequity masseurs

-   Generelt om GINW

```{r}
#gen weighted gini
#for all
gini.wtd(tmp$GDP_capita, w = tmp$pop)

tmp  %<>% 
  group_by(id_nuts2, year) %>% 
  mutate(gini_n2 = gini.wtd(GDP_capita, w = pop)) %>%
  ungroup() # to remove grouping
```

## Descriptive statistics Gini

### Cross country perspective

Tekst

```{r}
tmp %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>%  
  distinct(id_nuts2, year,.keep_all = TRUE) %>%  
  select(gini_n2) %>%  
  st()
```

Forklare data over

(ikkje ES under kun brukt som eksempel no)

```{r}
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "ES")  %>% 
  distinct(id_nuts2, year,.keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gini_n2, fill = id_nuts2, color = id_nuts2)) +
  geom_point(lwd = .8) +
   labs(x = "Year", y = "Gini")
```

## Outlier discussion

Tekst

```{r}
ggplot(tmp, aes(x = id_nuts0, y = gini_n2)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Discuss briefly if there are noteworthy outliers:

An important thing to come up here is that an outlier is a value or an observation that is distant from another observations, that is to say, a data point that differs significantly from other observations.

An observation must always be compared to other observations made on the same phenomenon.
In this assignment the focus is gdp per capita and gdp.
