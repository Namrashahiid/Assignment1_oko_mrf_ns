## 1 Introduction

In this assignment are we going to study the regional inequality of our selected European countries.
We are group two and will therefore examine these countries:

-   Ireland (IE)

-   Poland (PL)

-   Spain (ES)

-   Slovenia (SI)

-   Netherlands (NL)

-   Greece (EL)

-   Norway (NO)

-   Albania (AL)

# 2 Assignment 1

### 2.1 Data

The main task in this assignment will be to study regional inequality from 2000-2020 for our selected European countries.
We are in assignment 1 using two datasets from Eurostat.[^1]
These are "nama_10r_3gdp.csv" which consist of countries sub-regional GDP, and "demo_r\_pjanaggr3.csv" which consist of population data.
The main purpose of studying this dataset from Eurostat is to analyse regional inequality.
To do that, we need to use GDP (Gross Domestic Product), on the market and population data by NUTS 3 regions.
We will calculate GDP per capita and Ginie coefficients for eight subgroups of subregional countries (NUTS3).

[^1]: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/regions/data/database

We are calculating GDP per capita by:

![](images/GDPperCapita.png){fig-align="center"}

where *i* refers to NUTS3 regions.

```{r}
#Import data from Eurostat
gdpfile <- import("nama_10r_3gdp.csv")
popfile <- import("demo_r_pjanaggr3.csv")

#Clean data 
gdpfile %<>% select(unit, geo, TIME_PERIOD, OBS_VALUE)
popfile %<>% select(unit, geo, TIME_PERIOD, OBS_VALUE)

# Filter for the countries we are going to study and change variablenames
gdpdata <- filter(gdpfile, unit == "MIO_EUR" & (grepl('IE...', geo) | grepl('PL...', geo) | grepl('ES...', geo) | grepl('SI...', geo) | grepl('NL...', geo) | grepl('EL...', geo) | grepl('NO...', geo) | grepl('AL...', geo))) %>%
  mutate(gdp_n3 = OBS_VALUE, year = TIME_PERIOD, id_nuts3 = geo) %>%
  select(gdp_n3, year, id_nuts3)

# Filter for gdp per capita
popdata <- filter(popfile, unit == "NR" & (grepl('IE...', geo) | grepl('PL...', geo) | grepl('ES...', geo) | grepl('SI...', geo) | grepl('NL...', geo) | grepl('EL...', geo) | grepl('NO...', geo) | grepl('AL...', geo))) %>% 
  mutate(pop = OBS_VALUE, year = TIME_PERIOD, id_nuts3 = geo) %>%
  select(pop, year, id_nuts3)

#Generate main data frame
tmp <- merge(popdata, gdpdata, by = c("year", "id_nuts3"))

#Gen Nuts 2 id
tmp %<>%
  mutate(id_nuts2 = substr(id_nuts3,1,4))

#Gen Nuts 1 id
tmp %<>%
  mutate(id_nuts0 = substr(id_nuts3,1,2))
```

### GDP per capita calculation

Like mentioned in this assignment we will calculate GDP per capita, which is based on population by NUTS3.

To calculate GDP per capita we need to multiply the GDP value with 1 million because it is in million euro and dividing it by the population value.

```{r}
# Calculate GDP per capita
tmp %<>%
  mutate(GDP_capita = (gdp_n3 * 1000000)/pop)

tmp_gdpcapita <- tmp %>%
  select(year, id_nuts3, pop, GDP_capita)
```

## 2.2 Descriptive statistics raw data

### Cross country perspective:

What we can describe from our data (GDP per capita), using metadata description is that GDP measures the value of total final production.
Metadata can be defined as information that is necessary to be able to use and intercept statistics.
The main function of metadata is to explain data by giving definitions, for example according to our data, region, year, GDP, population and GDP per capita.
We now have information on GDP per capita in different regions from different countries that we have chosen.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summary_gdp
#| tbl-cap: Summary
# Report the essential descriptive statistics 
# for you data set (Mean, Min, Max,..:)
tmp %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  select(gdp_n3, pop, GDP_capita) %>% 
  # . to stop RStudio complaining about no data
  st()
```

Looking at [Table 1] and the table descriptive statistics table over, we can see substantial differences in region size as well as economic development.
The largest region, Rest of Dronningen (NL113) is almost 1000 times bigger than the smallest region, which is Agglomeratie Leiden en Bollenstreek (NL337).
We also see a big difference in gdp per capita.
The least wealthiest region of our dataset is in Poland, Nowotarski (PL219) and has a gdp per capita of 5652, while the wealthiest region Rest og Groningen (NL113) has a gdp per capita of 55857.
We also see a big difference in population.
The smallest region has a population of 10 603, and the largest have a population of 6 373 546.

From [Table 1] and [Table 2] we see that the wealthiest regions in our dataset are located in the Netherlands and in Norway, and that the least wealthiest regions are located in Poland.

```{r}
#| label: fig-gdp_pc_nuts0
#| fig-cap: Gdp per capita for NUTS0 
tmp %>%  distinct(id_nuts0, year,.keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = GDP_capita, fill = id_nuts0, color = id_nuts0)) +
  geom_line(lwd = .8) +
   labs(x = "Year", y = "GDP per capita")
```

When we look at graph 1, we see a common trend in forward growth in all of the countries.
Norway´s GDP are on the top (the blue line on top).
Norway have the highest GDP per capita.
Albania on the other side have the lowest GDP per capita.
Orange line is referring Albania´s GDP per capita.
If we compare Norway´s GDP with Albania´s.
There is huge difference there, because Norway is on the top and Albania on the other side at it´s lowest.

If we specify the GDP per capita for Norway (blue line), we can see that it started pretty nice in around 2006, but then suddenly we can see it kind of like had decline in GDP per capita.
The reason behind this is most probably because of the financial crisis, which affected the society in years 2008-2009.
Suddenly if we see GDP per capita started raising from 2009 again, and had its small fall downs in around 2015, and it raised again.
We see the same trend for the purple line and Poland.

In the middle the lines are showing the other countries.
They are mostly slightly rising.

```{r}
tmp_1 <- tmp %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>%  select(GDP_capita, id_nuts3) %>% 
  slice_min(GDP_capita, n = 10) %>%  select(id_nuts3)

#| label: fig-gdp_pc_pl
#| fig-cap: Gdp per capita for Poland
tmp %>%   
  filter(id_nuts3 %in% tmp_1 $ id_nuts3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = GDP_capita, fill = id_nuts3, color = id_nuts3)) +
  geom_line(lwd = .8) +
   labs(x = "Year", y = "GDP per capita")
```

Here we can see the GDP per capita for polish regions.
If we take a look at the orange line, which refers to PL214, we see that it had its down period to start with.
Not only (PL214) the orange line, but also all the other regions, does not start good.
PL214 (the orange line) had it´s real rise after 2010.
PL214 had its down time between years 2008-2009, most probably because of the financial crisis, which caused chaos in the whole world.
Except from this we see that all of the regions have a stable rising curve.

```{r}
tmp_1 <- tmp %>% 
  filter(year==2010) %>%  
  select(GDP_capita, id_nuts3)  %>% 
  slice_max(GDP_capita, n = 10) %>%  
  select(id_nuts3)

#| label: fig-gdp_pc_nl
#| fig-cap: Gdp per capita for Netherlands
tmp %>%   
  filter(id_nuts3 %in% tmp_1$id_nuts3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = GDP_capita, fill = id_nuts3, color = id_nuts3)) +
  geom_line(lwd = .8) +
   labs(x = "Year", y = "GDP per capita")
```

This table shows regional GDP per capita for the 10 highest income regions.
Nine of them are regions from the Netherlands which starts with NL\*\*\* and the last one refers to Norway and the region Nordland (NO071).
We can see here that region in Netherlands NL113 (the orange line) shows us that it´s on the top of all other regions in Netherlands and surprisingly Norway NO071 (the pink line).
Its most probably, because the region in Norway are only based on one specific region.
We can say that this region Nordland (NO071) has low GDP per capita, compared to some of the regions in the Netherlands, such as NL113.

### Individual country cases

With this GDP per capita for specific countries, we can easily filter our information/data afterwards in this assignment.
This can for example be done by finding the wealthiest and least wealthiest regions in each country.

### GDP per capita for Norway:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summary_Norway
#| tbl-cap: Summary Norway
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "NO" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(gdp_n3, pop, GDP_capita) %>%
  st()
```

Since Norway is the country with the highest GDP per capita it is interesting to stydy Norway closer.
When we look at the GDP per capita for Norway, we can see that there is no such big difference between the values under summary statistics, such as Min and Max, Mean, Std.
Dev, Pctl.
The values are exactly the same.
The reason behind this is that N value is 1.
When N is 1, than it makes sense why all these values are same.
Our dataset only have numbers for one region on NUTS3 level in Norway, even though there should be 19 counties.
We are therefore going take a closer look at other countries.

### GDP per capita for Spain:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wealthiest_ES
#| tbl-cap: 3 wealthiest regions in ES
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "ES" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, GDP_capita) %>%
  slice_max(GDP_capita, n = 3)
```

Looking at this table for the three wealthiest regions in Spain we see the GDP per capita for ES211 (the first region) and ES300 (the second region) and ES212 (the third region).
There is no such big difference in them.
The observation between these regions are somehow consistent.
If we look at our next table 4, we can see the least wealthiest regions in Spain.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-least_wealthiest_ES
#| tbl-cap: 3 least wealthiest regions in ES
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "ES" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, GDP_capita) %>%
  slice_min(GDP_capita, n = 3)
```

When we look at this table 4, we can see the least wealthiest regions in Spain.
Comparing GDP per capita from table 4 with table 3 we can see that there is difference between values in both tables.
The three wealthiest regions are twice as wealthy as the least wealthiest.

### GDP per capita for Poland

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wealthiest_PL
#| tbl-cap: 3 wealthiest regions in PL
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "PL" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, GDP_capita) %>%
  slice_max(GDP_capita, n = 3)
```

When we look at table 5 we see the wealthiest regions in Poland.
There are a difference of over 10 000 gdp per capita from the most wealthiest to the third most wealthy region.
Next we are going to see the GDP per capita for the least wealthiest regions in Poland.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-least_wealthiest_PL
#| tbl-cap: 3 least wealthiest regions in PL
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "PL" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, GDP_capita) %>%
  slice_min(GDP_capita, n = 3)
```

We can here see the least wealthiest regions in Poland.
We can see that there is big difference between the wealthiest regions from table 5 and table 6 (least wealthiest regions) in Poland.
The wealthiest region in Poland are almost 5 times wealthier than the least wealthy region in Poland.
This shows us that there are big differences in living conditions in Poland.

### GDP per capita for Slovenia

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wealthiest_SI
#| tbl-cap: 3 wealthiest regions in SI
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "SI" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, GDP_capita) %>%
  slice_max(GDP_capita, n = 3)
```

When we look at table 7 we see the wealthiest regions in Slovenia.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-least_wealthiest_SI
#| tbl-cap: 3 least wealthiest regions in SI
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "SI" , year == 2010) %>%
  select(id_nuts3, GDP_capita) %>%
  slice_min(GDP_capita, n = 3)
```

Here we see the least wealthiest regions in Slovenia.
In comparison to the wealthiest regions in Slovenia there are not that big gap.
Compared to the other countries we have looked at (Poland and Spain), there are smaller differences between the richest and the poorest regions.
Slovenia is generally not that rich compared to the other countries in graph 1.

## 2.3 Regional inequity measures:

When we talk about regional inequity measures, it is normal to talk about GINWj.
This is the inequality indicator that we use in our analysis in the population weighted gini coefficient.
It has a range from 0 (low/no inequaliy) to 1 (perfect inequality between regions).
The indicator is calculated like this:

![](images/GINI.png){fig-align="center"}

where *i* refers to NUTS3 regions and *j* refers to NUTS2 regions.
The indicators *i* and *j* specify region data for us.
GINWj/i data shows us different sizes of regions etc.

```{r}
#gen weighted gini
#for all
gini.wtd(tmp$GDP_capita, w = tmp$pop)

tmp  %<>% 
  group_by(id_nuts2, year) %>% 
  mutate(gini_n2 = gini.wtd(GDP_capita, w = pop)) %>%
  ungroup() # to remove grouping
```

## 2.4 Descriptive statistics Gini

### Cross country perspective:

```{r}
tmp %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>%  
  distinct(id_nuts2, year,.keep_all = TRUE) %>%  
  select(gini_n2) %>%  
  st()
```

The data over tell us descriptive statistics for inequality masseurs for the year 2010.
In our dataset we have 44 different European NUTS2 regions.
In averange we can see a very low level of inequality within all regions.
Even the maximum inequality is vey low with 0,199.
We can also see that mean is 0, which means that some regions have no inequality.
We look more at this in the next graph.

```{r}
#| label: fig-gini_netherlands
#| fig-cap: Gini Netherlands
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "NL")  %>% 
  distinct(id_nuts2, year,.keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gini_n2, fill = id_nuts2, color = id_nuts2)) +
  geom_line(lwd = .8) +
   labs(x = "Year", y = "Gini")
```

Studying the level of inequality over time for regions in Netherlands we see that most regions follow a common trend.
There are not a lot of changes over time.
This is for example shown in the graph over NUTS2 regions in the Netherlands.
We also see that one region has 0 for all observations, which means low/no inequality.

```{r}
#| label: fig-gini_spain
#| fig-cap: Gini Spain
tmp %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "ES")  %>% 
  distinct(id_nuts2, year,.keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gini_n2, fill = id_nuts2, color = id_nuts2)) +
  geom_line(lwd = .8) +
   labs(x = "Year", y = "Gini")
```

In Graph 4 here we can see descriptive data for Spain.
If we take a look at the green dots on top, we can see that it started pretty good at start, than had its fell down in around 2008-2009.
ES30 is the wealthiest of all others.
If we take a look at last dots, which are pink dots flat on the 0 line on the x-axis.
The reason behind this most probably because the region has no inequality as discusses earlier.
In this graph over level of inequality over time for Spain, there are some exceptions compared to the graph for Nederlands.
Taking a closer look at the light blue dotted line, we see that it is starting quite low, around 0,04, and increasing to almost 0,06 over 20 years.
This region has a different curve than the rest of the regions in Spain.

## 2.5 Outlier discussion

When we talk about Outlier discussion part its normal to define the word outlier.
The definition of this word is when a value or an observation is distant from other observation, that is to say, a data point that differs significantly from other data points.

```{r}
#| label: fig-outlier
#| fig-cap: Outliers
ggplot(tmp, aes(x = id_nuts0, y = gini_n2)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Discuss briefly if there are noteworthy outliers:

When we take a look at some kind of noteworthy outliers between these countries, we can take a look at the graph 5.
We can point out here that Ireland (IE) have some weird appearance in this graph.
We can see that somehow some outliers emerge for Ireland.
It start with a point, than suddenly have a big gap before the Gini starts raising again.
Than the gap continues and suddenly gini is back.
There is also a big difference in regional inequity for the different regions in Ireland.

If we compare Ireland´s (IE) gini with other countries, such as Netherland´s (NL), we can see that there is outliers here.
We can say that Ireland (IE) has an abnormal appearance, in comparison to for example Netherland´s (NL).

Albania (AL) on the other side has no outliers, because it does not have those gaps as Ireland (IE).
All regions have approximately the same regional inequity.

We can also see that five of the countries have regions with zero inequality.
This is weird.
A reason for this can be that regions with NA values get 0 instead of NA.
It could therefore make sense to exclude these observations in later studies.

As we have seen under individual country cases, we can see that Poland (PL) have very rich regions at the same time very poor regions as well.
As we can see on graph 5, we can see that there is no clear outliers on graph for Poland (PL), because there is a long line with with small gaps.
We can see that there are many wealthy and on the other side not wealthy regions in Poland.
This is not an outlier but still worth mentioning.

All the mentioned outliers except from the one with zero inequity are not do to a bias in our data, and we should therefore keep them.
However we need to test later the sensitivity of our findings regarding the presence of these borderline observations.

# 3 Assignment 2

In this assignment we are going to have our main focus on the same countries we have focused on in the first assignment.
In the first part of this assignment we will use the same data that were presented in the last assignment.

So the first task in this assignment is to estimate the effect of regional development yj on regional inequality GINIWj for the year 2010.
To study Growth and inequity, it is essential for us to look at and focus on GDP per capita.
GDP per capita is a indicator of economic performance and is very normal to use to analyse standards of living and for economical perspective.

Important fact to come up here is that, although GDP per capita is often used as a broad measure of average living standards, but high GDP per capita not necessarily mean high level of households disposable income, a key measure of average material capita in the OECD.

```{r}
tmp_n2 <- tmp %>%
  select(year, pop, gdp_n3, id_nuts2, gini_n2) %>% 
  group_by(id_nuts2, year) %>% 
  mutate(gdp_n2 = sum(gdp_n3), pop_n2 = sum(pop)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  distinct(id_nuts2, year, gdp_n2, pop_n2, gini_n2) %>%
  mutate(gdp_pc_n2 = (gdp_n2 * 1000000)/pop_n2) 
```

**Log:**

Further are we going to use log data in our codes.
The question is why are we going to use log?
A log in R wil transform our data in a way that will help reduce its skew.
In other words it will reproduce or rescale our data more in a statistical way.

```{r}
data2010 <- tmp_n2 %>%

# level of economic development = log(gdp per capita)
  mutate(log_gdppc = log(gdp_pc_n2)) %>% 
  # create column to easily filter by country
  mutate(id_nuts0 = substr(id_nuts2,1,2)) %>%
  filter(year == 2010)

data2010 %>%
  st(.)
```

(AL og IE har ingen observasjonar i året 2010)

Now when we look at the Summary Statistics we can see that some values/variables (gini values) are equal to 0.
What value 0 expresses is that there is perfect equality, where all the values are the same.
As we have mentioned earlier, the gini value is from 0 to 1 in the table.

The reason behind the values 0, can also be because of that maybe one of the values are missing.
Therefore this leads us to gini values 0.
We can also see that, many values are the same.
Now when we look at our summary statistics, we can see that some of our values are equal to 0.
For example in this case we find that Min and Pctl.
25 are equal to 0.
Under gini_n2 we find these 0 values.
As we mentioned earlier, the values are always between 0 and 1, and when the value is equal to 0 or close enough to 0, then this designate that the model/variable which we are working on is not that useful to analyze.

On the other hand we can see that, there is max, mean Std.Dev value that are not 0, but very close to zero on the first line.
Now the question is, whats the solution to those values of 0.
One important thing here to point out is that the reason behind that the values are equal to zero can be because of maybe there are some data/values that are lost or not there for this specific year which we have chosen.

Further down in Summary Statistics, we find N variables for countries: Spain (ES), Netherlands (NL), Norway (NO), Poland (PL) and Slovenia (SL).
What we can see is that Norway (NO) only have 1 variable, that is because it is only one region that is related to Norway (NO).
On the other side we see Spain (ES) have 19 variables.

We can not find our other countries, which are: Albania (AL), Ireland (IE).
The reason behind this is because our dataset have no observations for AL an IE in the year 2010.
Because we don´t have values of the countries which can not see, which are Albania (AL), Ireland (IE), Greece (EL), are we not going to focus on these countries in this assignment.

    labs(x = "log(GDP per capita)", y = "Gini")}
```

### Estimate the effect of regional development yj on regional inequality GINIWj for the year 2010:

What we are going to do here to describe the effect of regional development on regional inequality, and then we are going to analyze this by the help of using regression analysis.
Now the question is, what is regression analysis.
Regression analysis is a group of statistical processes and statistics, that help us or are useful to control the relationship between data set variables.

What we are going to take in the first place is the selected countries and data we have got for the year 2010.
After that are we going to use simple regression model to look at the result of regional development inequality.

Simple Regression analysis can be expressed like this:

$$
B1 = intercept or constant 
$$

$$
B2 =Slope coefficient
$$

$$
ui = error term
$$

```{r}
#| label: tbl-log-gdppc
#| tbl-cap: Estimate effect of regional development on regional inequality
#lm.1 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log_gdppc, data = IE2010)
lm.1 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log_gdppc, data = PL2010)
lm.2 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log_gdppc, data = ES2010)
lm.3 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log_gdppc, data = SI2010)
lm.4 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log_gdppc, data = NL2010)
lm.5 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log_gdppc, data = EL2010)
#lm.6 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log_gdppc, data = NO2010)
#lm.8 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log_gdppc, data = AL2010)
lm.6 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log_gdppc, data = data2010)

#Gen Table
  huxreg(
  list("Poland" = lm.1, "Spain" = lm.2, "Slovenia" = lm.3, "Netherlands" = lm.4, "Greece" = lm.5, "All countries" = lm.6 ),
  statistics = c(N = "nobs", R2 = "r.squared"),
  coefs = c(log_gdppc = "log_gdppc", const. = "(Intercept)"),
  note = "Note: {stars} T statistics in brackets."
  )
```

We have read Lessmann & Seidel (2017) we can find that development can be found by log GDP.

The table/graph up shows us that we have an relationship between X and Y.
X which is regional development in this case and Y which refers to regional inequality.
The formula which we have worked with above can clearly show us the relationship/ connection between these different variables.

One important thing here to come up with here is that when we look at the estimation effect of regional development on regional inequality above on table, we see data for only countries: Poland (PL), Spain (ES), Slovenia (SI) and Netherlands (NL).
Other countries such as Greece (EL), Norway (NO), Ireland (IE) and Albania (AL) have no data.
Therefore are we going to take initially countries with dataset, in this case: Poland (PL), Spain (ES), Norway (NO) and Albania (AL).

From this table we can see different values.
What wee see here for Poland (PL) is that there is 10 observations for this country and the coefficient of determination R2 is 0.398.
What we see here for Spain (ES) is that there is there is 11 numbers and the coefficient of determination R2 is 0.
Value 0 can be due to.
As mentioned the value 0 can be due to low fitness of the model.

**Regression analysis:**

Our next steps in this assignment is to take a look at what is regression analysis and what it tells us.
Regression analysis is a process which is used to see the relationship between different data set variables.
This analysis data method is used to see the relationship between independent and depended variables.

The formel we use for estimating the connection between regional development and regional inequality is:

$$ Regional inequality_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2Regional development_i+u_im$$

### Discuss the goodness of fit of your estimated model:

In this discussion part are we going to discuss our estimation in previous task.
First of all we can see that there is data for only 4 countries.
The countries are: Slovenia (SI), Spain (ES), Netherlands (NL) and Poland (PL).
If we plus the values R2 for all 4 countries, we get a value over 1.
Due to missing values in some of our countries are those countries with missing values not showing up.
Therefore our focus here is countries which are showing up, in this case: Slovenia (SI), Poland (PL), Netherlands (NL) and Spain (ES).

We are here looking at R2, which is value for coefficient of determination.

This R2 model does not tell whether your chosen model is fit or not.
R2 shows us how much variation of a dependent variable is explained by the independent variable in a regression model, because it is a statistical measure.

If we look at the R2 value for country Slovenia (SI), we can see that it is pretty high.
It is the highest value, which is 1.000.
The fact of the matter is that two values always fit one and other perfectly.

There is two observations that always fit one another perfectly; that is called a statistical artefact.
R2 has range of values form 0 to 1.

What we can analyze here by looking at this value R2 1.000 for Slovenia (SI), is that the value that is analyzed is suitable or fitted for each other.
On the other hand when we look at the R2 value for Spain (ES), we can see that it is 0.0.
This value indicates that, this model is not suitable for our model.

## Plot the relastionship between regional developement yi and regional inequality GINIWj, and the fitted line corresponding to your estimate:

In this part are we going to analyze estimation for four countries.
Countries which we are going to use as a estimation for our plots are: Spain (ES), Poland (PL), Slovenia (SI) and Netherlands (NL).

Coefficients of resolution is important for our next steps in this assignment.
So the first we are going to do is to analyze all four countries in one table.

```{r}
#| label: fig-lm-data2010
#| fig-cap: Estimate for data2010
lm_function_plot(data2010)
```

The graph shows us that when prosperity increases, income and GDP per capita are less different.
To figure out the effect or the connection between regional inequality and regional development, we will be using the linear regression model.

On this graph we can see Log GDP per capita on the x-axis and Gini nuts 2 values at the y-axis.

Now we are going to look at a simple regression model for our 4 countries.
In this case: Spain (ES), Poland (PL), Netherlands (NL) and Slovenia (SI).
We can see that the line on this graph is negative, this indicates that one of values on regression model formel, is negative.
The line on y-axis is on around value 0.12 and on x-axis on ca.
12.0.

The dots or the different colors indicates the regions in those 4 countries mentioned above.

[Fjerna figur.. Graph 8 shows us the estimation plotted for Spain (ES). We can see that it lies in the middle and is more flat a like horizontal line on the graph. We can see different regions from Spain spread all over the graph. The slope/line is on around 0.03 on y-axis and it is not touching or crossing the x-axis. We can analyze that the line on the graph is going a little towards the x-axis. There is no region that are crossing or touching the horizontal line.]{.underline}

[Fjerna figur ... We find that the slope/line here for Netherlands (NL) is positive. It seems like NL34 Zeelandic Flanders is approximately touching the slope/line in the graph. All other regions are spread all over.]{.underline}

```{r}
#| label: fig-lm-Poland
#| fig-cap: Estimate for Poland
lm_function_plot(PL2010)
```

We find that the slope/line here for Poland (PL) is also positive as for Netherlands (NL) above.
The slope/line is on 0.05 on y-axis.

## Plot the residual against the predicted values of your model:

In this next part we are analyzing residual, which is the difference between the observed value and the mean value, that the model predict for that specific observation.
In the next four graphs are we analyzing for same countries above.
The fact of the matter is that when the regression line is further from the region dot, then this indicated that the residual is highest.

The formel for Residual can we find under:

$$
Residual = Observed value - Predicted value
$$

```{r}
#Plot the residuals against the predicted values of your model
#reg1 <- lm(price ~ lotsize + sqrft + bdrms, data = hprice1) 4
#plot5
#reg %>% 6
  #ggplot(aes(x = fitted(reg), y = resid(reg))) +7
  #geom_point(color = "darkslategray", size = 3) +8
  #theme_simple + xlab("predicted values") + ylab("residuals")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-lm-data2010-res
#| fig-cap: Residuals all countries 
lm_residuals_plot(data2010)
```

[Endra figur ... What we can see from this graph is a ascending linear regression. For example the region in Poland PL51 Dolnoslaskie has high GDP per capita, and at the same time high Gini value.]{.underline}

[Fjerna figur ... What we see here from this graph is a regression analysis for Netherlands. We can see different type of data spread all over the graph. NL11 region i Netherlands East Groningen has the highest GDP per capita and Gini according to this Graph. It is also the region which is furthest away from the regression line.]{.underline}

[Fjerna figur ... This graph for Spain (ES) shows us a regression line. We can analyze that the slope/line is negative. What we can see here is how far away those regions are from the regression line. We can analyze that there are many region dots further from the mean value.]{.underline}

## Discuss the classical the assumption OLS in light of your data and plots:

First of all a definition to this classical OLS assumption: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression is a statistical technique for analyzing and designing linear relationship between a response and for one and even more variables.
If the relationship between two variables are linear, then straight line can be fit to the specific data which we have worked with.

In practice we can use OLS to estimate the regression coefficients using an estimator, which is called Ordinary Least Squares.
We use this OLS estimation to close parameters and to minimize the residual sum of squares.

The regression have this formula:

$$
Y= mx + c
$$

y can be defined as the response (dependent) variable, m is the slope, x is the predictor and c the intercept.

What advantages we get after using this scatter plot is that we get the so called strength, direction and form of the relationship that can be defined.

Classical assumptions of OLS contains:

**Linearity:** As long as the model which we are focusing on satisfies the OLS assumptions for linear regression, the estimates will be good.
Here the population relationship is linear.

**Sample Variation:** Can be defined as measure of dispersion of the observation around their sample mean.

**Random Sampling:** is a part of the sampling technique.
We have a random sample of our model.

**Homoskedasticity:** Here we look at the error term, which has the same variation.
Homoskedasticity can be defined as a robust for interference of our estimate.

The formula is like:

$$
Var(u|X)=o2
$$

When we look at the graph under, which is related to our question, we can see that the graph Residuals vs Fitted line on the left side is suitable for us.

**Normality:** The population error term is normally distributed with mean zero and variance.

Below we will look at how our data (NL, ES, EL, ...) fit the assumptions of OSL.

The graph, which is related to our assignment is the graph: Residuals vs Fitted values.

```{r}
#| label: fig-par-plot
#| fig-cap: Diagnostic plots
plot(lm.6)
```

[Endra figur ... What we can analyze here is that in the first graph for Netherlands (NL), we can see the comparison between Residuals and fitted values. The fact of the matter is that we want the red line as flat as possible. When we analyze the first graph we can see that the red line is kind of like a mountain shaped. The fitted values goes from 0.00 to 0.12. The values relies between these numbers.]{.underline}

We could have also discussed Breusch-Pagan Test here.
This test is used to determine if heteroscedasticy is present in a present regression analysis.
This test fits regression model, because it fits the residuals of a linear regression model.
We will look more in depth on this in our next assignment 3.

## 3.2 Other determinants of inequity:

### Data

In this next part we are going to use three new datasets form Eurostat.
These three datasets are related to demographics, education and transport infrastructure.
We have chosen these files: 'demo_r\_pjangroup.csv', 'edat_lfse_04.csv' and 'tran_r\_vehst.csv'.

#### Transport infrastructure

The file 'tran_r\_vehst.csv' shows us stock and vehicles by category and NUTS2 regions.

What we can see on this table is dataset for participation rate in education and training.
The age class this dataset is for is for people from age 25 to 64 years old.
On the left side of the Table in Eurostat we can find countries, regions, province under time GEO.
We can find data for years 2017-2021 on this dataset.
The time frequency is shown: annual.
The unit of measure is shown in Percentage.

#### Education

Next the file 'edat_lfse_04.csv' shows the population by educational attainment level, sex and NUTS 2 regions (%).

This dataset presents data on the heighest level of education successfully completed by the individuals of a given population.

The data shown here is annually calculated of EU Labour Force Survey data.

We are focusing on edat_lfse \_04 here, which shows us population by educational attainment level, sex and NUTS 2 regions (%).

#### Demographics

Finally the 'demo_r\_pjangroup.csv' shows us the population on 1 January by age group, sex and NUTS 2 region.

This dataset shows us population and social conditions.
This data set contains information of usually resident population and represents the number of inhabitants of a given area on 1st January of the year.

```{r, echo = FALSE, show_col_types = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Import new data from Eurostat
demo <- read_csv('demo_r_pjangroup.csv') %>%
  filter(TIME_PERIOD == "2010" & unit == "NR" & (grepl('IE..', geo) | grepl('PL..', geo) | grepl('ES..', geo) | grepl('SI..', geo) | grepl('NL..', geo) | grepl('NO..', geo) | grepl('AL..', geo))) %>%
  select(unit, geo, age, sex, TIME_PERIOD, OBS_VALUE) %>%
  mutate(demo1 = OBS_VALUE, year = TIME_PERIOD, id_nuts2 = geo) %>%
  select(id_nuts2, year, demo1)

edu <- read_csv('edat_lfse_04.csv') %>%
filter(TIME_PERIOD == 2010 & age == "Y25-64" & sex == "TRUE" & isced11 == "ED0-2" & unit == "PC") %>%
  filter( grepl('IE..', geo) | grepl('PL..', geo) | grepl('SI..', geo) | grepl('NL..', geo) | grepl('ES..', geo) | grepl('NO..', geo) | grepl('AL..', geo)) %>%
  select(unit, geo, age, sex, TIME_PERIOD, OBS_VALUE) %>%
  mutate(edu1 = OBS_VALUE, year = TIME_PERIOD, id_nuts2 = geo) %>%
  select(id_nuts2, year, edu1)

infra <- read_csv('tran_r_vehst.csv') %>%
  filter(TIME_PERIOD == "2010" & unit == "NR" & vehicle == "TOT_X_TM" & (grepl('IE..', geo) | grepl('PL..', geo) | grepl('ES..', geo) | grepl('SI..', geo) | grepl('NL..', geo) | grepl('NO..', geo) | grepl('AL..', geo))) %>%
  select(unit, vehicle, geo, TIME_PERIOD, OBS_VALUE) %>%
  mutate(infra1 = OBS_VALUE, year = TIME_PERIOD, id_nuts2 = geo) %>%
  select(id_nuts2, year, infra1)
```

```{r}
data2010 <- tmp_n2 %>%
  left_join(edu, by = c("year", "id_nuts2")) %>%
  left_join(infra, by = c("year", "id_nuts2")) %>%
  left_join(demo, by = c("year", "id_nuts2")) %>%

  # create id_nuts0 to filter by country
  mutate(id_nuts0 = substr(id_nuts2,1,2)) %>%
  filter(year == "2010") %>%
  
  group_by(id_nuts2, year)

data2010 <- data2010 %>%
  filter(gini_n2 > 0)

PL2010 <- data2010 %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "PL") 
ES2010 <- data2010 %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "ES") 
SI2010 <- data2010 %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "SI") 
NL2010 <- data2010 %>%
  filter(id_nuts0 == "NL") 
```

**Multiple Regression model:**

After focusing on simple regression model, are we now moving on to multiple regression model.
Question is what is multiple regression model?
It can be defined as a statistical technique that can be used to analyze the relationship or the connection between several independent and only one single depended variable.

```{r}
multi_linear_regression_model_1 <- function(mlrdata){
lm.1 = lm(gini_n2*1000 ~ gdp_pc_n2, mlrdata)  %>%
  coeftest(vcov = hccm, save = TRUE)
lm.2 = lm(gini_n2*1000 ~ gdp_pc_n2 +I(edu1/100), mlrdata) %>%
  coeftest(vcov = hccm, save = TRUE)
lm.3 = lm(gini_n2*1000 ~ gdp_pc_n2 +I(infra1/1000), mlrdata) %>%
  coeftest(vcov = hccm, save = TRUE)
lm.4 = lm(gini_n2*1000 ~ gdp_pc_n2 + I(demo1/1000), mlrdata) %>%
  coeftest(vcov = hccm, save = TRUE)
lm.5 = lm(gini_n2*1000 ~ gdp_pc_n2 +I(infra1/1000) + I(edu1/100) + I(demo1/1000), mlrdata) %>%
  coeftest(vcov = hccm, save = TRUE)

#Gen Table
  huxreg(
  list("(1)" = lm.1, "(2)" = lm.2, "(3)" = lm.3,"(4)" = lm.4,"(5)" = lm.5),
  statistics = c(N = "nobs", R2 = "r.squared"),
  #coefs = c(education = "edu1", transportInfrastructure = "infra1", demographics = "demo1", const. = "(Intercept)"),
  #coefs = c(Const. = "(Intercept)", GdpPerCapita = "gdp_pc_n2", Education = "I(edu1/1000)", Infrastructure = "I(infra1/1000)", Demographics = "I(demo1/1000)"),
  stars = c("***" = 0.01, "**" = 0.05, "*" = 0.10),
  note = "Note: {stars} T statistics in brackets."
  )
}
```

### Estimate a multiple linear regression model with your new variables for 2010 and give a small interpretation of your findings

When we look at the Multiple regression model, we use these variables:

$$
Yi = B0 + B1X1i + B2X2i + ...+ BkXki + ui
$$

```{r}
#| label: tbl-mlr-data2010
#| tbl-cap: Multi linear regression model data2010
multi_linear_regression_model_1(data2010)

```

### Discuss the overall fit of your model:

What has happend here is that we get many values that are 0.
The reason behind this can be that we have many repeating regions (example: 16 ES11 regions).
We came to a solution some days ago, but suddenly at the last minute the problem occurred.

If we analyze or discuss our table above we find we can see that education, infra and life.exp has 0 as value.
We see that Netherlands and Poland has same quantity of values.
We are going to analyze Netherlands here, because this is country which we have looked at much in our assignment.
What we are analyzing here: education, infrastructure, transport and demography.

### Discuss the inference related to your findings

"Estimate a multiple linear regression model with you new variables for 2010 and give a small interpretation of your findings."

For this last part we ar only looking at one country.
We have chosen Netherlands because it is the country with the highest GDP per capita and the most NUTS2 regions.

We will now test and analyze is if the variables has an effect upon growth and inequality.

When it comes to calculation of variables, we use hypothesis test.
Hypothesis test can be defined as a statistical inference that uses data.

We use:

$$
H_0: β = 0
$$

$$
H_a: β ≠ 0
$$

#### Education

```{r}
#| label: tbl-inference-edu
#| tbl-cap: Education linear model
lm(gini_n2 ~ edu1 , data = NL2010) %>% tidy()%>% kable(., digits=2)
```

What we can find here is that education has its p-value on 0.79.
The estimation value is on the intercept 0.05.
A large p value, indicated a weak evidence against the null hypothesis.
Therefore we can not reject it.

#### Infrastructure

```{r}
#| label: tbl-inference-infra
#| tbl-cap: Infrastructure linear model
lm(gini_n2 ~ infra1 , data = NL2010) %>% tidy()%>% kable(., digits=2)
```

When wee look at the p value for the infrastructure, we find that the p value is 0.68.
A large p-value indicates that it is a weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject it.
In this case p-value on 0.68 is pretty high and there is weak evidence against the null hypothesis.

#### Demographics

```{r}
#| label: tbl-inference-demo
#| tbl-cap: Demographics linear model
lm(gini_n2 ~ demo1, data = NL2010) %>% tidy()%>% kable(., digits=4)
#qt(0.95,100)
```

Here the p-value is 0.8794, which again is not possible to reject, because there is weak evidence against the null hypothesis.

# 4 Assignment 3

In this assignment are we going to focus on Alternative function forms.

## Test if the effect of development is significantly different for different subset of countries in your data set:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-mlr-only_greece
#| tbl-cap: Multi linear regression model .......
data2010NED <- data2010 %>%
  filter(id_nuts2 != 'EL') 

data2010$GRC <- ifelse(data2010$id_nuts0 == "EL", 1,0)
data2010$Oth <- ifelse(data2010$id_nuts0 == "EL", 0,1)

data2010 <- data2010
lm.10 = lm(gini_n2*1000 ~ gdp_pc_n2, filter(data2010, GRC == 1))
lm.11 = lm(gini_n2*1000 ~ gdp_pc_n2, filter(data2010, GRC == 0))
lm.12 = lm(gini_n2*1000 ~ gdp_pc_n2 * GRC , data2010)

#Gen Table
  huxreg(
  list("Only Greece" = lm.10, "No Greece" = lm.11, "Interaction" = lm.12),
  statistics = c("N" = "nobs", 
      R2 = "r.squared", "F statistic" = "statistic",
      "P value" = "p.value"),
   stars = c("*" = 0.1, "**" = 0.05, "***" = 0.01),
  note = "Note: {stars} T statistics in brackets.")
```

Here in this task are we going to check if the effect of the development is significantly different for different subset of countries in our dataset.
The country we are looking at is Greece.
We have chosen the country Greece, because it is the country that have the most observations of our selected countries.
It is important here to point out that significance test is a given output of the t-test in R.
What this test is that this provides the t-value, kind of freedom and corresponding p-value.
We have to do a hypothesis test.
What would be sensible to do here is to perform a to-sided (tailed) hypothesis test:

$$
H0: B1 = 0
$$

Now when we are going to do a statistical significance, we are given a p-value.
Here in this case we have to represent a two-sided tailed test, because, in most of cases p-value is for two sided/tailed test.

When we look at the bottom line, we can see where it says Note: \*\*\* p \< 0.01; \*\* p \< 0.05; \*p \< 0.1

The first p-value p \< 0.01 tell us that the significance level is on 1% (0.01), the second one 5% (0.05) and the third one 10% (0.1).
Now if we are using a two-tailed test with a significance level of for example 0.05, then a two-tailed test divide this 0.05 value in two.
0.025 per side, in other words test half of the alpha to testing the statistical significance in one side/tail and half on the other.

If we look at *No Greece* model, we can see that the p-value is: 0.059.
If we now take initially the significance level 0.05 (5%).
We can here conclude by saying, that we are not able to reject the null hypothesis, because the p-value is higher than the significance level:

$$
0.059>0.05
$$

Now we are going to look at the Only Greece modeø.
The p-value for Only Greece is 0.007.
If we compare 0.007 with a significance level of 0.05 (5%), we than immediately know that we have to reject the null hypothesis, because the p-value is smaller that the significance value/level.
Rejecting the null hypothesis because:

$$
0.007<0.05
$$

When we take a look at the interaction model, this interaction model tells us or in other words allow us to find the effect between No Greece model and Only Greece model.

If we look at intercept p-value on 0.063 and on the other use 0.05 (5%) significance level, we can conclude by saying that we can not reject the null hypothesis here because the p-value is larger than the significance level on 0.05.

$$
0.063>0.05
$$

## Explore alternative functional forms (e.g. log, cubial estimate, ...) of your previous estimates on the relationship between regional development yi on regional inequality GINIWj. Give an argument for two forms that might fit the data better:

To find out the answer to this question/task we have to find out what the definition to log estimates and cubical estimates is.
Log, logarithm can be defined as the inverse function to exponentiation.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-mlr-all_counties
#| tbl-cap: Multi linear regression model .......
data2010 <- data2010
lm.13 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log(gdp_pc_n2) , data2010) %>%
coeftest(vcov = hccm, save = TRUE)
lm.14 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log(I(gdp_pc_n2)^2), data2010) %>%
  coeftest(vcov = hccm, save = TRUE)
lm.15 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log(I(gdp_pc_n2)^3), data2010) %>%
  coeftest(vcov = hccm, save = TRUE)
lm.16 = lm(gini_n2 ~ log(gdp_pc_n2)*GRC, data2010) %>%
  coeftest(vcov = hccm, save = TRUE)
#Gen Table
  huxreg(
  list("All countries (log)" = lm.13, "All countries (log) ^2" = lm.14, "All countries ^3" = lm.15, "Interaction" = lm.16),
  statistics = c("N" = "nobs", 
      R2 = "r.squared", "F statistic" = "statistic",
      "P value" = "p.value"),
   stars = c("*" = 0.1, "**" = 0.05, "***" = 0.01),
  note = "Note: {stars} T statistics in brackets."
  )
```

Here in this task are we are we going to look at all of countries.
Now the question is what does Log\^2 tell us.
Log\^2 is a mathematical function that calculates the binary logarithm.

If we look at the interaction (intercept) value, which is 0.534, we can say here that it is pretty high, which can indicate that there in a interaction between log and log\^2 in all countries.

Now looking at the p-value for interaction, which is: 0.016.
If we take 0.05 (5%) as a significance level, we can see that the p-value is smaller than the confidence level 0.05.
Here we can conclude by saying that we have to reject the null hypothesis.

$$
0.016<0.05
$$

We can see that totally there is 45 observation (N) for all countries.

### Plot the corresponding scatter plots with the estimate line:

Scatter plot in R, can be defined as a type of plot that is used to display the relationship between two numerical variables, and plots.
The dots shown on the scatter plot table shows us the dot for each observation.
The X-axis have one type of variables, and the Y-axis have other type of variables.
The variables on both axis results plotting against one another.

```{r}
#| label: fig-mlr-scatterplot_fittedline
#| fig-cap: Corresponding scatter plot with the fitted line  
ggplot(data = data2010, aes(x = gini_n2, y = gdp_pc_n2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Gini") +
  ylab("GDP per capita")
```

### Report the related estimates:

As we can see this scatter plot is representing two dimensional data.
As we can see on the x-axis we find Gini value and on the other side on the y-axis we can find the information for GDP per capita.
The fact of the matter is that placement of the values on x-axis and y-axis represent if the correlation between x-axis and y-axis is positive or negative.
This all depends on as mentioned the placement/position of the values on the plot.
The ending point on the x-axis is 0.20 and on the y-axis is 4000.

Here the relationship between gini and GDP per capita is shown in this scatter plot.
Now when we have more then two varaiables, we want to here find the correlation between the one variable and the all others.

When we look at our scatter plot for the gini and GDP per capita, we can immediately see that it is a negative trend.
We find here gini on GDP per capita.
We can see on the plot that there is two lines.
One is linear negative regression line and other is mathematically said quadratic function, which goes somehow up and down.
We find a fitted line in this scatter plot that this shows us data along with the fitted line.

As we can see there is a positive relationship between gini and GDP per capita, but there is not a moderately strong relationship.
We can see that the fitted linear regression line is negative.
The quadratic line shows us that the line fits the on 0.025 gini and 2500 GDP per capita.
This can be defined as correlation relationship at this point.

We have some values that are unusual or easily said they are extreme, because they do not fit the line or they are far away from the line.
Here in this case we are talking about the value (dot), which is on the top on the right side gini on 0.18 and approximately on 4300 on GDP per capita.
The value is a bit far away from the values.

### Give a verbal interpretation of your estimate coefficients:

### Test for heteroskedasticity in the two new and the old model:

Heteroskedasticity can be defined as, when all observations of the response (the dependent variable) come from distributions with the same variance.

The reason why heteroskedasticity happens is, because when the standard deviations of a variable monitored over a specific time.

```{r}
#Estimate  lineær
